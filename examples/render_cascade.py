"""Render every session of one cascade as one readable document.

    python3 -m examples.render_cascade [<cascade-id>] > cascade.md

Derived from `tools/dump_turns.py` in prime-agents-vs-jaato, which renders
ONE session: prose, every tool call with its arguments, every result.  The
driver's stdout reports outcomes; the transcript shows the reasoning that
produced them, and the two can disagree.

What is added here is the part a cascade needs and a single session cannot
have: **the siblings are rendered together.**  Sessions carry
``cascade_driver_id`` and ``sibling_name``, so they can be grouped and
labelled — and the tool calls in ``turn_accounting`` carry timestamps, so a
genuine cross-session TIMELINE can be built even though history rows
themselves are not timestamped.

That timeline is the whole point.  A writer asking for a snippet and the
coder answering are two events in two different transcripts, and neither
file alone shows the exchange.
